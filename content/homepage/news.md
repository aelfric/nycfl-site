* League moderators will meet on Saturday, September 9,  at Iona Preparatory Upper School, 255 Wilmot Rd, New Rochelle, NY 10804, at 9:30 a.m. This meeting usually runs until
  about noon, and Iona typically provides a light breakfast (coffee, juice, bagels, etc.).  There will be a "zoom option" for those who need to attend virtually, but everyone
  is welcome in person in New Rochelle.  During the meeting, we settle the calendar of competitions (including which schools will be hosting which events), discuss revisions
  to competition rules, make some decisions about the league's finances, and set league policies. Suggestions for agenda items should be sent to Charlie Sloat, our tournament
  director, at [charlie4n6@gmail.com](mailto:charlie4n6@gmail.com), and to Tom Beck, our president, at [tbjnyc@gmail.com](mailto:tbjnyc@gmail.com).
